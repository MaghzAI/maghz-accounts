## 🔐 Double-Entry Validation

### Rules Enforced
1. **Balance Rule**: Total Debits = Total Credits
2. **Line Rule**: Each line has either Debit OR Credit (not both)
3. **Minimum Lines**: At least 2 lines required
4. **Account Validation**: All accounts must exist and be active

### Example Transaction (Invoice)
```
Date: 2025-10-01
Type: Invoice
Description: Sale to Customer A

Lines:
  Accounts Receivable (1100)  Debit:  $1,000  Credit: $0
  Sales Revenue (4000)         Debit:  $0      Credit: $1,000

Total Debit: $1,000
Total Credit: $1,000
✓ Balanced
```

  changes: { transaction: {...} }
}
```

## 📚 Accounting Concepts Implemented

### Double-Entry Bookkeeping
Every transaction affects at least 2 accounts:
- One account is debited
- Another account is credited
- Total debits must equal total credits
- This maintains the accounting equation:
  **Assets = Liabilities + Equity**

### Transaction Types
1. **Invoice**: Debit AR, Credit Revenue
2. **Expense**: Debit Expense, Credit Cash/AP
3. **Payment**: Debit AP, Credit Cash
4. **Receipt**: Debit Cash, Credit AR
5. **Journal**: Manual adjustments

### Normal Balances
- **Assets**: Debit increases, Credit decreases
- **Liabilities**: Credit increases, Debit decreases
- **Equity**: Credit increases, Debit decreases
- **Revenue**: Credit increases, Debit decreases
- **Expenses**: Debit increases, Credit decreases

### Reconciliation
- Transactions can be marked as reconciled
- Reconciled transactions cannot be deleted
- Ensures data integrity for auditing

## 🎓 Key Learnings

### Zod Custom Refinements
Used `.refine()` to implement complex validation:
- Balance check (debits = credits)
- Line validation (debit XOR credit)
- Custom error messages

### Real-time Calculations
- Total debits/credits calculated on every change
- Balance indicator updates immediately
- Submit button disabled until balanced

### Type Safety
- Strict TypeScript interfaces
- Zod infers types from schemas
- No `any` types used

### User Experience
- Visual feedback (colors, icons)
- Helpful error messages
- Confirmation dialogs
- Loading states
- Empty states

## 🔗 Integration Points

### With Chart of Accounts
- Transactions reference accounts by ID
- Only active accounts shown in dropdown
- Account code and name displayed

### With Audit Trail
- All deletions logged
- User ID captured
- Changes stored as JSON

### Future Integration
- Customer/Vendor linking (Module 7)
- Bank reconciliation (Module 8)
- Financial reports (Module 6)
- Dashboard widgets (Module 5)
